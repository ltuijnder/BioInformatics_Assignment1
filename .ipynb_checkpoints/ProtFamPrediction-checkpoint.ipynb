But it simply to compute intensive to again train at every protein. So have the classifier already trained and ready. (This is actually not correct).. (think about it)\n",
    "    - Look into how we can compare different length proteins. I think the best approach is to get a few summarising values out if it. and then construct a very simple classifier. NNN or descision tree. \n",
