    "\n",
    "The data file imported via the module `pandas` using the function `read_csv`, we now have hold of a `pandas.dataframe` object which is basically a fancy excel table. We can tell the dataframe that we want to group our data on the column on the proteins such that we can easily just loop over protein per protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should also group the data by `PDB_chain_code` since our data sets contains instance of proteins  that are present multiple times (4 times \"1n7s\", and 2 times \"1wmh\") but have a different `chain_code` attachted to them. One protein can fold in different ways and hence form different secundary strucutres (SS), so to our analysis with the GOR we treat them as different proteins. \n",
